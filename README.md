# DAO

A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, is an entity that is not governed by a central authority, but rather the individuals within the organisation itself. This provides transparency and gives everyone the opportunity to cast their opinion.
This code contains a smart contract, where holders of a specific NFT token, grants access to a DAO. These NFT holders may create proposals that other members of the DAO may then vote on. If there is a majority consensus on a proposal after the voting period has ended the DAO can then move forth on acting on said proposal.
